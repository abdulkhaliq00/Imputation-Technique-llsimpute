Local Least Squares Imputation Code.
Project-C19

----How to run code on R Cloud----

Make use of R Cloud to run the code as its easy to install packages and upload datasets.

1. Initially open a New projec > New R Project

2. Go to bottom right pane file > upload > choose file > dataset.Rmd > upload 

3.Click on the file and the notebook get populated in the script section

4. Proper comments are used to execute each code chunk.

5. Datsets are stored in the environment are to which can be further for preview.

6. All packages and library functions are providied to solve the imputation. 

---How to run the code on Google Colab---

Make use of this link to access colab for R Link: https://colab.to/r

1. Open above link > File > upload notebook > dataset.ipynb 

2. Check for runtime type : Runtime > change runtime type >  R > Save

3.  Proper comments are used to execute each code chunk.

4. Datasets should be uploaded using right vertical pane: Files > upload > datasets.xlsx
